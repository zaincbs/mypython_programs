A general in ancient China came to see a Zen master.

He drew his sword and pointed it at the teacher, and 
announced: "Don't you know that I am a man who can 
run you through without blinking an eye?"

To which the Zen master responded instantly: "Don't 
you know that I am a man who can be run through 
without blinking an eye?"

Deeply impressed, the general sheathed his sword and 
remained for the teaching.
